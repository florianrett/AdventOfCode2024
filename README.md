# Getting Input
Automatically retrieving custom puzzle input from AoC requires setting a session cookie for the application to use.
[How to get the session cookie](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1)
tldr: Browser console -> Network -> open/refresh puzzle input page -> read session cookie from request header

The session cookie (without 'session=') has to be copied into a file called 'sessioncookie.txt' in the project's root folder.

# Personal Goals
This year I want to solve the puzzles in C++ to get more proficient with stl.
